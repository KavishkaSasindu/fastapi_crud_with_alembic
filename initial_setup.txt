first create virtual environment

then activate it ---> source venv/bin/activate

next install dependencies
    fastapi = for fastapi
    mysqlclint = for mysql server databases driver
    uvicorn = to run fastapi app
    pydantic-settings = for define initial configuration with environment variables
    python-dotenv = for python dotenv file and configure variables
    alembic = for migrations with databases

create app directpry inside it other files goes. But main.py in root directory

inside app -->
             config directory  == first create this with Settings class
             db directory == second databse integrations
             models directory == third models
             (use alembic for migrations)
                alembic init alembic 
                    (then in alembic ini file change the sqlalchemy_url = keep this blank)
                    (in env.py file change the required /import settings with databse url, and change online connect with create engine)
                    (import base model file to get metadata and change target metdata = Base.metadata)
                    after that run == alembic revision --autogenerate -m "create current model migrations to table"
                                      alembic upgrade head
             schemas directory
             routers directory(service layer)
             controller (controller layer)
